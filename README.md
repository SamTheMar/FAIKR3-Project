# FAIKR3-Project

## Introduction

Postoperative patient care has several components: - surveillance, âˆ’ prevention of complications associated with surgical disease or other preexisting comorbidities, âˆ’ specific postoperative treatment of the surgical disease and its complications. While these distinctions are purely didactic, the postoperative care merges into an active surveillance with a higher level of standardization than it would seem at first glance.

The goal of this project is to determine where patients in a postoperative recovery area should be sent to next. Because hypothermia is a significant concern after surgery, the attributes correspond roughly to body temperature measurements.

Number of Instances: 90

Number of Attributes: 9 including the decision (class attribute)

Attribute Information:

1. L-CORE (patient's internal temperature in C):
            
            high (> 37), mid (>= 36 and <= 37), low (< 36)
2. L-SURF (patient's surface temperature in C):
              
              high (> 36.5), mid (>= 36.5 and <= 35), low (< 35)
3. L-O2 (oxygen saturation in %):
              
              excellent (>= 98), good (>= 90 and < 98),
              fair (>= 80 and < 90), poor (< 80)
4. L-BP (last measurement of blood pressure):
              
              high (> 130/90), mid (<= 130/90 and >= 90/70), low (< 90/70)
5. SURF-STBL (stability of patient's surface temperature):
              
              stable, mod-stable, unstable
6. CORE-STBL (stability of patient's core temperature)
              
              stable, mod-stable, unstable
7. BP-STBL (stability of patient's blood pressure)
              
              stable, mod-stable, unstable
8. COMFORT (patient's perceived comfort at discharge, measured as
              
              an integer between 0 and 20)
9. ADM-DECS (discharge decision):
              
              I (patient sent to Intensive Care Unit),
              S (patient prepared to go home),
              A (patient sent to general hospital floor)
